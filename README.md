# Blue-Teaming-Projects
Structured documentation of my 30-Day Blue Teaming Challenge, focused on building practical SOC/blue team skills. Tracks my daily progress, projects, and labs in log analysis, SIEM, incident response, threat detection, automation workflows, and more. All work is hands-on and organized to demonstrate real-world defensive security capabilities.
